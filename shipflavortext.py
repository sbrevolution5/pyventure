In the cockpit you see your laser pistol, water bottle, snack stash, Oxygen rebreather, the picture of Becky (your long ago love that you bought the Everess to impress before she.... well... better to focus on you for now....) and emergency flashlight. \n Red lights begin to blink across the console of your ship.
